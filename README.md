# EXPENSE-MANAGER-AN-EXPENSE-TRACKING-APPLICATION-USING-IMAGE-PROCESSING
(Prototype Model which scans the receipts and automatically updates the expense details to the database into different categories) Tech Stack: Python, OpenCV, Tesseract, PyTorch, MPAndroidChart, Android Studio, Cloud Storage, Relational Database.
The project is an expense management system leveraging image processing and text extraction techniques to categorize expenses from bill images. Through Tesseract OCR, it extracts textual data, identifies total amounts, and detects specific patterns within the extracted information. Employing a AI rule-based classification system with NLTK, it sorts expenses into predefined categories like entertainment, investment, grocery, etc. The system saves categorized expenses into separate CSV files for systematic financial tracking and analysis. Visual representation of expense distribution across categories using Pandas and Matplotlib allows users to gain insights into their spending behaviors. An expense tracking application utilizing image processing presents an innovative approach to streamline financial management. By leveraging machine learning algorithms, it accurately identifies and categorizes expenses, automatically updating the user's financial records. Overall, the project showcases an expense manager that combines image processing, rule-based categorization, and visualization for effective financial tracking.
